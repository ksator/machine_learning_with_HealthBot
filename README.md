# About this repository 

Using HealthBot, it is easy to collect data from the network devices, to store the data collected in a database, and to use machine learning for anomaly detection.  
The purpose of this doc is to help peoples with no machine learning background to better understand machine learning basics.  
It may seem weird to describe how to calculate a standard deviation, a variation, a Euclidean distance, an argmin, â€¦ but this is required to fully understand how k-means clustering works.
