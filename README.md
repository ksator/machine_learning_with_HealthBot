# About this repository 

Using HealthBot, it is easy to collect data from the network devices, to store the data collected in a database, and to use machine learning for anomaly detection or outlier detection.   

- The file [machine_learning_with_HealthBot.pdf](machine_learning_with_HealthBot.pdf). The purpose of document is:  
    - to help peoples with no machine learning background to better understand machine learning basics. 
    - to describe machine learning usage with Healthbot  
- The file [3sigma.xlsx](3sigma.xlsx) computes the three-sigma rule 
- The file [kmeans.xlsx](kmeans.xlsx) computes one iteration of k-means with k=2  
- This repository has also configuration examples of HealthBot using machine learning to detect anomalies.
