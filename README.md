# About this repository 

Using HealthBot, it is easy to collect data from the network devices, to store the data collected in a database, and to use machine learning for anomaly detection or outlier detection.   

In this repository, you will find: 
- The file [machine_learning_with_HealthBot.pdf](machine_learning_with_HealthBot.pdf). The purpose of this document is:  
    - to help peoples with no machine learning background to better understand machine learning basics. 
    - to describe machine learning usage with Healthbot  
- The file [3sigma.xlsx](3sigma.xlsx). It computes the three-sigma rule 
- The file [kmeans.xlsx](kmeans.xlsx). It computes one iteration of k-means with k=2  
- Automation content to configure HealthBot:
  - Healthbot will use openconfig to collect data from Junos devices 
  - Healthbot will store the data collected in its database
  - Healthbot will use machine learning algorithms to detect anomaly   

# About HealthBot 

You can use HealthBot to collect data from the network devices, store the data collected in its database, process the data collected.  
Here's the HealthBot documentation https://techlibrary.juniper.net/documentation/product/en_US/contrail-healthbot 

# HealthBot and machine learning 

HealthBot supports machine learnings for anomaly detection and for outlier detection.  

HealthBot supports the following machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection:  
- Three-sigma rule  
- k-means for anomaly detection  

HealthBot supports the following machine learning algorithms for outlier detection: 
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- K-fold Three-sigma ("K-Fold Cross-Validation" using "Three-sigma")

Anomaly detection and outlier detection are both about detecting anomalies.  
In HealthBot terminology:  
- anomaly detection is time based. It compares new data points from a device vs data points collected from the same device during a learning period.  
- outlier detection is group based. It analyzes data from a device during a learning Period vs data from other devices during the same learning period

# lab building blocks   

- Junos devices 
- One Ubuntu VM with healthbot

# lab management IP addresses 

Here are the management ip addresses I am using in my scripts.  
You can use less Junos devices if you want

# Junos packages

In order to collect data from Junos using openconfig telemetry, the devices require the Junos packages ```openconfig``` and ```network agent```

Starting with Junos OS Release 18.3R1: 
- the Junos OS image includes the ```OpenConfig``` package; therefore, you do not need anymore to install ```OpenConfig``` separately on your device.  
- the Junos OS image includes the ```Network Agent```, therefore, you do not need anymore to install the ```network agent``` separately on your device.  

This setup is using an older Junos release, so it is required to install these two packages. 

Download these two packages from Juniper website and save them in your local directory.    

Execute the python script [upgrade_junos.py](upgrade_junos.py) to add these two packages to the Junos devices indicated in this [inventory.yml](inventory.yml) file   

Install the requirements:
```
$ sudo apt install python-pip
$ pip install junos-eznc
```
Update the devices inventory: 
```
$ vi inventory.yml
```
Run this command to execute the python script [upgrade_junos.py](upgrade_junos.py)
```
$ python ./upgrade_junos.py
```
ssh to a Junos device and verify it uses these packages:
```
jcluser@vMX1> file list

/var/home/jcluser/:
junos-openconfig-x86-32-0.0.0.10-1.tgz
network-agent-x86-32-18.2R1-S3.2-C1.tgz

```
```
jcluser@vMX1> show version | match "Junos:|openconfig|na telemetry"
Junos: 18.2R1.9
JUNOS na telemetry [18.2R1-S3.2-C1]
JUNOS Openconfig [0.0.0.10-1]
```

# Junos configuration

we will the python script [configure_junos.py](configure_junos.py) to configure the lab.

This script uses: 
- the template [junos.j2](configure_junos/junos.j2) 
- the variables [junos.yml](configure_junos/junos.yml) 

It generates the junos configuration for each device in the [inventory.yml](inventory.yml) file and load the junos configuration on devices.  
 
Install the requirements: 
```
$ sudo apt install python-pip
$ pip install junos-eznc
$ pip install jinja2
```
Run this command to update the devices inventory file:
```
$ vi inventory.yml
```
Run this command to configure the lab:  
```
$ python configure_junos.py
configured device vMX1
configured device vMX2
configured device vMX3
configured device vMX4
configured device vMX5
configured device vMX6
configured device vMX7
```
The generated junos configuration files are saved in the directory [configure_junos](configure_junos).  
```
$ ls configure_junos
```
ssh to a junos device and check bgp sessions state. The sessions should be established.  
To audit BGP sessions using Python, run this command: 
```
$ python audit_junos.py
vMX1
bgp session with peer 192.168.1.1+179 is Established
bgp session with peer 192.168.1.3+179 is Established
