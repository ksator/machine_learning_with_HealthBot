# Why this repository 

Using HealthBot, it is easy to collect data from the network devices, to store the data collected in a database, and to use machine learning for anomaly detection.  
The purpose of this doc is to help peoples with no machine learning background to better understand machine learning basics.  
It may seem weird to describe how to calculate a standard deviation, a variation, a Euclidean distance, an argmin, â€¦ but this is required to fully understand how k-means clustering works.  

# Anomaly detection vs outlier detection 

HelthBot supports machine learnings for anomaly detection and for outlier detection.  
HealthBot supports the following machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection:  
- Three-sigma rule  
- k-means for anomaly detection  

HealthBot supports the following machine learning algorithms for outlier detection:  
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)  
- K-fold Three-sigma ("K-Fold Cross-Validation" using "Three-sigma")  

Anomaly detection and outlier detection are both about detecting anomalies.   

In HealthBot terminology:  
- anomaly detection is time based. It compares new data points from a device vs data points collected from the same device during a learning period.   
- outlier detection is group based. It analyzes data from a device during a learning Period vs data from other devices during the same  learning period  

# Supervised learning

Learning with a teacher.  
The machine learning algorithm learns on a labeled dataset  
 
# Unsupervised learning  

Learning without a teacher.   
The machine learning uses unlabeled dataset.  
The advantage of using an unsupervised technique is that we do not need to have labeled data, i.e., we do not need to create a training dataset that contains examples of outliers.  
k-means clustering and DBSCAN are unsupervised clustering machine learning algorithms.  
They group the data that has not been previously labelled, classified or categorized.  

# Machine learning model  

This is the output generated when you train your machine learning algorithm with your training data-set.  
The machine learning model is what you get when you run the machine learning algorithm over your training data.  
Once The machine learning model is built, it can be used to classify new data points.
