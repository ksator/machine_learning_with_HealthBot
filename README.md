# About this repository 

Using HealthBot, it is easy to collect data from the network devices, to store the data collected in a database, and to use machine learning for anomaly detection or outlier detection.   

# What to find in this repository

The purpose of this documentation is to help peoples with no machine learning background to better understand machine learning basics.  
It may seem weird to describe how to calculate a standard deviation, a variation, a Euclidean distance, an argmin, â€¦ but this is required to fully understand how k-means clustering works.  

The file [3sigma.xlsx](3sigma.xlsx) computes the three-sigma rule 

The file [kmeans.xlsx](kmeans.xlsx) computes one iteration of k-means with k=2  

This repository has also configuration examples of HealthBot using machine learning to detect anomalies.  

# About Machine learning with HealthBot 

HealthBot supports machine learnings for anomaly detection and for outlier detection.  

HealthBot supports the following machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection: 
- Three-sigma rule 
- k-means for anomaly detection 

HealthBot supports the following machine learning algorithms for outlier detection:  
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) 
- K-fold Three-sigma ("K-Fold Cross-Validation" using "Three-sigma") 

Anomaly detection and outlier detection are both about detecting anomalies.  

In HealthBot terminology:  
- anomaly detection is time based. It compares new data points from a device vs data points collected from the same device during a learning period.  
- outlier detection is group based. It analyzes data from a device during a learning Period vs data from other devices during the same learning period
