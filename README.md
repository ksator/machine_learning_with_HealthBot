# HealthBot and machine learning support

The file [machine_learning_101.pdf](machine_learning_101.pdf) helps peoples with no machine learning background to better understand machine learning basics    

HealthBot supports machine learnings for anomaly detection and for outlier detection.  

## anomaly detection

HealthBot supports the following machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection:  
- Three-sigma rule  
- k-means for anomaly detection  

## outlier detection

HealthBot supports the following machine learning algorithms for outlier detection: 
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- K-fold Three-sigma ("K-Fold Cross-Validation" using "Three-sigma")

## anomaly detection vs outlier detection

HealthBot supports machine learnings for anomaly detection and for outlier detection.  

Anomaly detection and outlier detection are both about detecting anomalies.  
In HealthBot terminology:  
- anomaly detection is time based.  
  It compares new data points from a device vs data points collected from the same device during a learning period.  
- outlier detection is group based.  
  It analyzes data from a device during a learning Period vs data from other devices during the same learning period

## three-sigma rule 

### Overview

sigma is the greek letter σ. This is also the Standard Deviation symbol  
HealthBot uses 3-sigma rule for anomaly detection.  
Three-sigma rule classifies a new data point as "normal" if it is between the (mean – 3 * standard deviations) and (mean + 3 * standard deviations)  
Three-sigma rule classifies a new data point as "abnormal" if it is outside this range.  

mean:  mean of the data set  
SD: standard deviation of the data set  
abs: absolute value  
x: a new data point  
If abs(x - mean) > (3 * SD) then tree-sigma classifies x as abnormal  
If abs(x - mean) < (3 * SD) then tree-sigma classifies x as normal  

Please refer to the file [machine_learning_101.pdf](machine_learning_101.pdf) for more details  

### Calculate it by hand  

Data points = 101, 102, 106, 107  
Mean = (101 +102 + 106 + 107)/4=104  
((101-104)^2 + (102-104)^2 + (106-104)^2 + (107-104)^2)/4 = (9 + 4 + 4 + 9)/4 = 6.5  
standard deviation = √6.5 = 2.54  
3 * standard deviation = 7.62  
mean – 3 * standard deviation = 96.38  
mean + 3 * standard deviation = 111.62  
Three-sigma rule classifies a new data point as “normal” if it is between 96.38 and 111.62  
Three-sigma rule classifies a new data point as “abnormal” if it is outside this range    

### HealthBot rule example  

HealthBot rule using OpenConfig telemetry to monitor the number of BGP prefixes received per peer, and using a dynamic threshold computed by three-sigma to detect anomaly: https://github.com/ksator/machine_learning_with_HealthBot/blob/master/rules/check-bgp-routes-with-3-sigma.rule  

## k-means for anomaly detection

### Overview 

"k-means clustering" and "k-means for anomaly detection" are two different things.  

"k-means clustering" splits n data points into k clusters.  

"k-means for anomaly detection" uses "k-means clustering" and others building blocks as well to identify "abnormal" data points (data points significantly different from the majority of the data).   

HealthBot uses "k-means for anomaly detection" to build a model and to classify new data points as normal or abnormal.  

Please refer to the file [machine_learning_101.pdf](machine_learning_101.pdf) for more details  

### HealthBot rule example

HealthBot rule using OpenConfig telemetry to monitor the number of BGP prefixes received per peer, and using a dynamic threshold computed by k-means to detect anomaly: https://github.com/ksator/machine_learning_with_HealthBot/blob/master/rules/check-bgp-routes-with-k-means.rule  

## K-fold Three-sigma  

"K-fold Three-sigma" is "k-Fold Cross-Validation" using "Three-sigma"  
The algorithm used by "k-Fold Cross-Validation" is "tree-sigma" rule     

HealthBot can use "K-fold Three-sigma" for outlier detection  
We need to indicate to HealthBot which dataset to use (as example "number of BGP prefixes sent" or "cpu load").  
For this dataset, "K-fold Three-sigma" analyzes data from a device during a configurable learning Period vs data from other devices during the same learning period  

K is the number of devices: if the group has 4 devices, then k=4, so HealthBot will use "4-fold three-sigma".  

In that case, 4 models are built and evaluated by HealthBot.  

Model1: Trained with the data points collected during the learning period from device 1 and device 2 and device 3, then tested with the data points collected during the learning period from device 4   

Model2: Trained with the data points collected during the learning period from device 1 and device 2 and device 4, then tested with the data points collected during the learning period from device 3  

Model3: Trained with the data points collected during the learning period from device 1 and device 3 and device 4, then tested with the data points collected during the learning period from device 2  

Model4: Trained with the data points collected during the learning period from device 2 and device 3 and device 4, then tested with the data points collected during the learning period from device 1  

HealthBot returns 1 if it detects an outlier, and 0 if there is no outlier detected.  

## DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

# Machine learning usage with HealthBot 

## How to use machine learning for anomaly detection with HealthBot

HealthBot can use machine learning for anomaly detection (to classify new data points as `normal` or `abnormal`).   

HealthBot supports the following machine learning algorithms: 
-	Three-sigma for anomaly detection
-	k-means for anomaly detection.  

For each algorithm, we need to configure: 
-	the learning-period
-	the pattern-periodicity 

Machine learning model: 
-	This is the output generated when you train your machine learning algorithm with your training data-set. The machine learning model is what you get when you run the machine learning algorithm over your training data. 
-	Training the machine learning algorithm to build models is done every day by HealthBot at midnight. 
-	The machine learning model is then used in production to handle new data points.  

Learning-period is configured to determine how much historical data the machine learning algorithm uses to build the models. 

For example, if learning period is 7 days, every time we build the models, we fetch past 7 days of data and we train the machine learning algorithm to build new models.  

if the learning period is 7 days, when learning is triggered the 12th Feb 2019 (00:00) to build new models, we fetch data from 5th Feb 2019 00:00 to 12th Feb 2019 00:00 and train the machine learning algorithm.  

If the learning period is 1 month, when learning is triggered the 12th Feb 2019 (00:00), we fetch data from 12th Jan 2019 00:00 to 12th Feb 2019 00:00 and train the machine learning algorithm to build new models.  

pattern-periodicity: 
-	If we configure ‘1D’ ‘pattern-periodicity’, it means that data of each day of the week has different patterns. So HealthBot creates 7 buckets, one for each day in a week (Monday, Tuesday, …). 
-	If we configure ‘1H’ ‘pattern-periodicity’, it means that regardless of which day, week or month, data of every hour has specific pattern. So HealthBot creates 24 buckets, one for each hour (00:00-00:59, 1:00-1:59, 2:00-2:59 … 23:00-23:59). 
-	If we configure ‘1D 1H’ ‘pattern-periodicity’, it means that for every day, data for each hour has different pattern. So, we would have 7 * 24 = 168 buckets. For Monday 24 buckets (1 for every hour), for Tuesday 24 buckets (1 for every hour) and so on. Here it does not matter in which months we are collecting the data from. 
-	…

For a machine learning algorithm to be able to build a model for a bucket, it requires a minimum number of data points. This depends on what algorithm we are using. 
-	3-sigma requires only a couple of points per bucket. 
-	k-mean requires at least 32 data points per bucket. 

Once the models are built, they are used in production to handle new data points. HealthBot uses machine learning for anomaly detection with dynamic thresholds. HealthBot uses the models it built to classify new data points as `normal` or `abnormal`.  

If the data set used to build the models was small, the result will not be accurate. With larger data set to build the models, results accuracy will increase.  

HealthBot builds models based on pattern periodicity.  
With a pattern periodicity of 1 hour, 24 buckets are formed (one for each hour).  

Learning period is only used to fetch the data to build the models.  
For example, if we have data for past one year, but we have configured learning period as 30 days, in this case, though we have data for past one year, at every midnight when we are re-building the models, we will fetch only past 30 days of data, bucketize the data points based on the pattern periodicity and build one model for each bucket.  

Minimum learning period can be the time where you can have minimum data points required to build a model for each bucket. But keep learning period larger to have more accurate results.  

Let’s take an example:  
Let’s say at 13:00 p.m we configure HealthBot to collect data from network devices every 5 seconds and to use k-means for anomaly detection with dynamic thresholds with a pattern periodicity of 1 hour.  
24 buckets are formed (one for each hour).  
Models are built daily at midnight. Until then HealthBot will return -1 as there is no model built yet for any of the buckets. So, during the first day, HealthBot will return -1 for each new data point.  
At midnight the first day, k-means will try to build the models: 
-	The models for hours 00 – 12 can’t be built yet as there is no data collected yet to build these models. So, during the second day, HealthBot will keep returning -1 until 12:59 p.m. 
-	Since k-means will have enough data per bucket/hour for hours 13 - 23 (k-means requires at least 32 data points per bucket, and we have 12 * 60 = 720 data points for each of these buckets), it will build the models for these 11 hours/buckets only. From 13:00 p.m the second day, since the models are available, for each new data point, HealthBot will return 0 (normal) or 1 (abnormal).  

So, the second day, HealthBot will return -1 for hours 00 – 12 and 0 and/or 1 for hours 13 - 23  

At midnight the second day, we have data for all hours 0 – 23 (one day of data for hours 0 – 12 hours and 2 days of data for 13 – 23 hours).  

Now since we have enough data points for all the hours/buckets, models for all the hours will be built, and HealthBot will return 0 (normal) or 1 (abnormal) for each new data point it will receive.

## lab building blocks   

- Junos devices 
- One Ubuntu VM with healthbot installed  

## lab topology

Here's the lab topology I am using (spines and leaves).    
You can use less Junos devices if you want
![topology.png](resources/topology.png)  

## lab management IP addresses 

Here are the management ip addresses I am using in my scripts.  
If you are using other ip addresses, you need to update the file [inventory.yml](inventory.yml) to use your ip addresses  

You can use less Junos devices if you want

| Device        | Management IP address           |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| healthbot        | 100.123.35.0 |
| vMX1      | 100.123.1.0 |
| vMX2      | 100.123.1.1   |
| vMX3      | 100.123.1.2   |
| vMX4      | 100.123.1.3   |
| vMX5      | 100.123.1.4   |
| vMX6      | 100.123.1.5   |
| vMX7      | 100.123.1.6   |

## Junos packages

In order to collect data from Junos using openconfig telemetry, the devices require the Junos packages ```openconfig``` and ```network agent```

Starting with Junos OS Release 18.3R1: 
- the Junos OS image includes the ```OpenConfig``` package; therefore, you do not need anymore to install ```OpenConfig``` separately on your device.  
- the Junos OS image includes the ```Network Agent```, therefore, you do not need anymore to install the ```network agent``` separately on your device.  

If your setup is using an older Junos release, it is required to install these two packages:    
- Download these two packages from Juniper website and save them in your local directory.    
- Execute the python script [upgrade_junos.py](upgrade_junos.py) to add these two packages to the Junos devices indicated in this [inventory.yml](inventory.yml) file   

Update the devices inventory: 
```
$ vi inventory.yml
```
Run this command to execute the python script [upgrade_junos.py](upgrade_junos.py)
```
$ python ./upgrade_junos.py
```
ssh to a Junos device and verify it uses these packages:
```
jcluser@vMX1> file list

/var/home/jcluser/:
junos-openconfig-x86-32-0.0.0.10-1.tgz
network-agent-x86-32-18.2R1-S3.2-C1.tgz

```
```
jcluser@vMX1> show version | match "Junos:|openconfig|na telemetry"
Junos: 18.2R1.9
JUNOS na telemetry [18.2R1-S3.2-C1]
JUNOS Openconfig [0.0.0.10-1]
```

## Junos configuration

we will the python script [configure_junos.py](configure_junos.py) to configure the lab (IP fabric with EBGP)    

This script uses: 
- the template [junos.j2](configure_junos/junos.j2) 
- the variables [junos.yml](configure_junos/junos.yml) 

This script: 
- generates a junos configuration file for each device indicated in the [inventory.yml](inventory.yml) file
- saves the generated configuration files in the directory [configure_junos](configure_junos) 
- loads the junos configuration files on the devices  
 
Run this command to update the devices inventory file:
```
$ vi inventory.yml
```
Run this command to configure the lab:  
```
$ python configure_junos.py
configured device vMX1
configured device vMX2
configured device vMX3
configured device vMX4
configured device vMX5
configured device vMX6
configured device vMX7
```
The generated junos configuration files are saved in the directory [configure_junos](configure_junos).  
```
$ ls configure_junos
```
ssh to a junos device and check bgp sessions state. The sessions should be established.  
To audit BGP sessions using Python, run this command: 
```
$ python audit_junos.py

## HealthBot configuration 

The HealthBot rule:  
- [check-bgp-state-using-openconfig.rule](rules/check-bgp-state-using-openconfig.rule) uses OpenConfig telemetry to monitor BGP sessions state (without machine learning)  
- [check-bgp-routes.rule](rules/check-bgp-routes.rule) uses OpenConfig telemetry to monitor the number of BGP prefixes received per peer, and uses a static threshold (provided as a variable) (without machine learning).  
- [check-bgp-routes-with-3-sigma.rule](rules/check-bgp-routes-with-3-sigma.rule) uses Openconfig telemetry to continuously monitor the number of bgp prefixes received, and uses `3 sigma` rule to classify the new datapoints as `normal` or `abnormal`  
- [check-bgp-routes-with-k-means.rule](rules/check-bgp-routes-with-k-means.rule) uses Openconfig telemetry to continuously monitor the number of bgp prefixes received and uses `k-means for anomaly detection` machine learning algorithm to classify the new datapoints as `normal` or `abnormal`  

The playbook [machine-learning-for-bgp.playbook](playbooks/machine-learning-for-bgp.playbook) monitors the number of BGP prefixes received using the rules:
- [check-bgp-state-using-openconfig](rules/check-bgp-state-using-openconfig.rule) (BGP sessions monitoring)  
- [check-bgp-routes](rules/check-bgp-routes.rule) (static threshold without machine learning)  
- [check-bgp-routes-with-3-sigma](rules/check-bgp-routes-with-3-sigma.rule) (dynamic threshold with 3 sigma)   
- [check-bgp-routes-with-k-means](rules/check-bgp-routes-with-k-means.rule) (dynamic threshold with k means)   

Run the script [configure_machine_learning.py](configure_machine_learning.py) to:   
- load to Healthbot the playbook [machine-learning-for-bgp.playbook](playbooks/machine-learning-for-bgp.playbook)
- load to Healthbot the rules 
  - [check-bgp-routes](rules/check-bgp-routes.rule) 
  - [check-bgp-routes-with-3-sigma](rules/check-bgp-routes-with-3-sigma.rule) 
  - [check-bgp-routes-with-k-means](rules/check-bgp-routes-with-k-means.rule)
  - [check-bgp-state-using-openconfig](rules/check-bgp-state-using-openconfig.rule)
- create a device-group `vmx` with devices `vMX1` to `vMX7` 
- instanciate the playbook [machine-learning-for-bgp.playbook](playbooks/machine-learning-for-bgp.playbook) against the device-group `vmx`  

```
$ python configure_machine_learning.py
loaded healthbot rule check-bgp-state-using-openconfig.rule
loaded healthbot rule check-bgp-routes.rule
loaded healthbot rule check-bgp-routes-with-k-means.rule

$
```

Healthbot is now continuously monitoring the number of bgp prefixes received (using Openconfig telemetry) and storing the data collected in its database.  
It is using the `k-means for anomaly detection` algorithm and `3 sigma` rule to build two machine learning models.  
Once the the machine learning models are built, it will use them to classify the new datapoints as `normal` or `abnormal`   

## Update the number of BGP prefixes received  

Healthbot is collecting on each devices the number of BGP prefixes received.   

To update the number of BGP prefixes received, you can use the python script [update_routes.py](update_routes.py).  
- This script uses the template [update_routes.j2](update_routes.j2).  
- It generates a junos configuration file every 60 seconds with 101 to 109 static routes (randomly), and loads this file to the Junos device vMX1 (using the replace option).  

This junos device (vMX1) uses BGP and advertises its static routes to its BGP peers  
So when we run the python script [update_routes.py](update_routes.py), it makes the number of BGP prefixes received on vMX1 peers changing every 60 seconds  

Run this command to execute the python script [update_routes.py]update_routes.py).  
```
$ python machine_learning/update_routes.py
```
Run these commands to verify: 
```
$ ps -ef | grep update_routes.py
$ more update_routes.conf 
$ ls update_routes.conf -l
$ date
```
Run these commands on vMX1 (ip 100.123.1.0) to verify:
```
jcluser@vMX-addr-0> show system commit
jcluser@vMX-addr-0> show system uptime
jcluser@vMX-addr-0> show configuration | compare rollback 1
jcluser@vMX-addr-0> show configuration routing-options static
jcluser@vMX-addr-0> show route advertising-protocol bgp 192.168.1.1
```
Run this command on vMX1 peer (ip 100.123.1.4 as example) to see the number of BGP prefixes received 
```
jcluser@vMX-addr-4> show bgp summary
```
